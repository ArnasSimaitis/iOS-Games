# iPhone Games

This project is designed for educational purposes. Through this project, I am exploring the basic concepts of `Swift`.

Currently, there are two games available: `Minesweeper` and `Guess the Number`.

The code isn't licensed by me, so feel free to use it. However, please refer to the official Apple documentation for any potential licensing issues.

## Games

### Guess the Number

The game is complete. The app generates two random numbers. The player's task is to guess which number the program has chosen as the correct one. A text indicator will inform you if your guess was correct.

### Minesweeper

The game is currently under development.

Here's what's been done so far:
1. The program generates a grid composed of blocks.
2. Bombs are randomly assigned to these blocks.
3. Each block is assigned a value that represents the number of bombs it is adjacent to.
